Hi! My name is Chao-Wei Huang. I received my B.S. and Ph.D. from National Taiwan University, advised by [Prof. Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/).

My research interests include **information retrieval**, **factuality**, **large language models**, and **speech processing**. My research has been published in top-tier speech and natural language processing conferences, e.g., ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, ICASSP, Interspeech, and EACL. Driven by a commitment to fostering academic collaboration, I have co-organized [The 9th Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC9)](https://dstc9.dstc.community/) and the [1st TamingLLM workshop](https://ctrlnlg.github.io/).
Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at **Amazon Alexa AI** ('20, '21) and **Meta AI Research** ('22, '23).
